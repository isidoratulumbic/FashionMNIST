# FashionMNIST

Developed and implemented a machine learning model for classifying clothing items based on images from the FashionMNIST dataset. The project includes training and evaluating the model using three different machine learning algorithms: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost algorithm. The performance of the models was compared based on accuracy and other relevant metrics to identify the best-performing algorithm. This repository contains the code, dataset preparation steps, and detailed evaluation results.
